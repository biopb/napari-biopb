"""In-kernel parent-death watcher (installed via ``IPKernelApp.exec_lines``).

The MCP launcher holds the *write* end of a pipe whose *read* end is inherited
by the kernel (the fd number is passed in ``BIOPB_PARENT_DEATH_FD``). When the
launcher **process** dies for any reason — ``SIGKILL``, OOM, segfault, crash —
the OS closes its write end, this watcher's blocking ``os.read`` returns EOF,
and the kernel group-kills itself. That reaps the kernel *and* the dask child
processes it spawned (same process group) instead of orphaning the whole tree
(issue #13, failure mode 1).

Why a pipe and not ``PR_SET_PDEATHSIG``: the parent-death *signal* is tied to
the **thread** that forked the kernel, so it fires early when a transient
restart/respawn thread exits. The pipe is tied to the launcher **process** and
is cross-platform (POSIX), so it stays correct across respawn and restart.
