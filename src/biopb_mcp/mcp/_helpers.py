    """Wait for the current view's slice to load before a screenshot.

    With async slicing on (``mcp.viewer.async_slicing``) a dims/zoom change
    fetches the new slice *off* the Qt main thread, so a screenshot taken right
    after could capture the previous (pre-load) frame -- fine for an interactive
    human, wrong for the agent, which expects ``take_screenshot`` to reflect the
    state it just set. This (1) submits a fresh slice of the current view so a
    slice is guaranteed in flight even if the triggering event hasn't dispatched
    yet, then (2) pumps the Qt event loop until every layer reports ``loaded``
    -- so the slice completes and is applied -- before the caller captures.

    The re-submit reads the current view's chunk a second time, but that read
    is a cache hit (the in-flight slice already warmed the server/client chunk
    cache), so it is cheap; the guarantee it buys -- no stale capture when the
    view changed but the slice wasn't requested yet -- is worth it. The pump,
    not napari's bare ``submit``, is what actually *awaits* completion:
    ``submit`` returns the async future without blocking, so ``layer.loaded`` +
    ``processEvents`` is the await. Runs on the kernel main thread (where the
    screenshot snippet already runs) so pumping lets the slice's main-thread
    apply callback fire.

    No-op when async slicing is off (synchronous slicing already left the view
    loaded) or when there are no layers. Bounded by *timeout* so a genuinely
    slow/stuck read degrades to a best-effort capture rather than hanging.
