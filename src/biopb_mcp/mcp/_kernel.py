"""KernelHost: owns a single child Jupyter kernel for MCP code execution.

The kernel is a separate process (started via ``jupyter_client``) that hosts
the napari viewer, dask, and the TensorFlightClient.  Running agent code there
— instead of on napari's Qt event-loop thread — means a runaway execution can
be interrupted (``SIGINT``) or hard-restarted (group ``SIGKILL`` + respawn)
without taking down the MCP server process.

A single ``threading.RLock`` serializes access to the one shared kernel.
