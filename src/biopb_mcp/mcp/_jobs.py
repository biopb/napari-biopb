"""In-kernel async job runner for the MCP execute_code path.

Runs *inside* the child Jupyter kernel.  ``execute_code`` submits agent code
here; it executes in a **background daemon thread** so the kernel's main thread
(and its integrated ``%gui qt`` Qt event loop) stays free to service quick tool
calls — ``take_screenshot`` / ``server_status`` / ``poll_job`` — while a
multi-minute job runs.  Long C calls will block context switching, although dask,
gRPC and numpy all drop GIL, so the job and the viewer/tools are expected to run
smoothly.

Design notes
------------
* **One job at a time.** A second :func:`submit` while a job is running is
  rejected with the running job id (the single shared viewer / namespace makes
  concurrent mutation unsafe).
* **Main-thread affinity.** The viewer is a Qt/vispy object bound to the kernel
  main thread.  GUI mutations from the worker thread are marshaled via
  :func:`run_on_main`; ``_bootstrap`` wraps ``add_tensor`` + the ``add_*``
  family so the common paths are automatic.
* **Output capture.** A thread-aware stdout/stderr dispatcher (installed once by
  :func:`install`) routes a job thread's prints into that job's buffer instead
  of the kernel's iopub stream — keeping worker output out of iopub and away
  from the main-thread ``<<JOB_JSON>>`` reply line.
* **Cancellation is cooperative.** :func:`cancel` sets a per-job event that job
  code may poll via ``cancelled()``; when a distributed dask client is active
  (the default kernel-local ``LocalCluster``) it *also* cancels the client's
  in-flight futures — the only mid-``compute()`` stop short of
  ``restart_kernel``.  The in-process ``threads`` / ``synchronous`` schedulers
  have no futures to cancel, so a running ``compute()`` under them can only be
  stopped by ``restart_kernel``.
