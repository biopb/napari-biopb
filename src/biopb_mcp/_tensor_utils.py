    server-side decode, so the redundant center slice roughly doubles cold load
    time. Pinning the initial view to the origin makes the displayed slice
    coincide with the thumbnail slice -> one decode instead of two.

    Trade-off: the default view sits at index 0 on the sliced axes (e.g. the

    """Build resolution-pyramid levels for a tensor in napari display order.

    When the server advertises a pyramid (the open-time descriptor carries one;
    see :func:`_advertised_pyramid_levels`), each level is requested by its
    advertised ``scale_hint`` *and* ``reduction_method`` so the client's
    chunk_ids match what the server serves and pre-warms. The config-driven plan
    below is the fallback for servers that advertise none.

    That fallback uses one unified rule for 2-D and 3-D data and bounds napari's
    3-D whole-volume read (issue #29). All knobs come from the ``pyramid`` config
    section (``config`` defaults to the on-disk config):

    - ``threshold`` -- max x/y extent of the coarsest level (caps 2-D reads),
    - ``downscale_factor`` -- linear step between levels,
    - ``pixel_budget_cubic_root`` -- per-axis floor; its cube is the max voxels
      (``Lx*Ly*Lz``) allowed in the coarsest level, bounding the whole-volume
      read napari issues in 3-D. Stored as the cube root (not the product) so
      the floor and the budget are exact integers, free of cube-root rounding.

    Each level is requested at the current per-axis scale, then x, y and z are
    downsampled *individually* -- skipping any axis that has reached the floor
    (``pixel_budget_cubic_root``, capped at ``threshold``) -- until the coarsest
    level fits both the voxel budget and ``threshold`` in x/y. The floor keeps
    small axes (channels, time, thin z) from being over-shrunk and guarantees
    termination: once every axis is at or below it, ``Lx*Ly*Lz <= floor**3 <=
    budget`` and ``Lx, Ly <= threshold``. A tensor without a z axis is treated
    as ``Lz = 1`` and never gets a z scale factor.

    The per-level extents are read from the *returned* array's shape, not
    computed as ``L // scale`` -- the server's downsample rounding (floor vs
    ceil) is not part of the API contract, so trusting the real shape keeps the
    budget check correct either way.

    **Output axis order.** napari displays the *last* ndisplay axes by position
    and ignores ``dim_labels`` for layout, so a source advertising an
    out-of-order layout (``[Y, X, C]``, a buried Z, swapped X/Y) would render
    the wrong plane silently. Using the labels (per-tensor, falling back to
    *source_desc*), each level is transposed so X is last, Y second-to-last, and
    Z third-to-last -- with a singleton Z *inserted* when the tensor has none.
    The result is therefore **always** in canonical ``[..., Z, Y, X]`` order
    (rank >= 3), which lets ``build_layer_scale`` map physical sizes onto fixed
    trailing positions without re-deriving the labels. The transpose is a lazy
    dask graph relabel; the real server emits ordered axes, so it is normally a
    no-op guard.

        List of dask arrays at canonical ``[..., Z, Y, X]`` resolution levels.
