    Two hazards the process-wide ``CONFIG`` singleton (issue #31) introduces for
    tests:

    1. *State leakage* -- the cache persists across tests, so a value loaded (or
       written) in one test would bleed into the next.
    2. *Non-hermeticity* -- call sites now hit ``CONFIG.get(...)``, whose first
       access reads the developer's real ``~/.config/biopb-mcp/config.json``.

    This autouse fixture points ``Path.home()`` at a per-test ``tmp_path`` (so an
    untouched config resolves to defaults) and invalidates the cache before and
    after each test. ``monkeypatch`` is function-scoped, so tests that set their
    own ``Path.home`` / ``get_config_dir`` compose with this -- their setattr
    runs later and wins, sharing the same ``tmp_path``.
