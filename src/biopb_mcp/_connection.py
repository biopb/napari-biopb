"""Standalone tensor data-access service.

Owns the :class:`~biopb.tensor.TensorFlightClient`, the source catalog, and the
server URL/token resolution + persistence. Both the napari ``TensorBrowserWidget``
and the MCP kernel *consume* this service rather than the widget owning the
client.

This module deliberately imports **no Qt and no napari** so it can be used (and
unit-tested) without a GUI — only ``biopb.tensor`` and the local config module.

Threading: a ``TensorConnection`` instance is mutated on the Qt main thread (the
widget's auto-connect tick and button handlers) and read in the same kernel
process during ``execute_code``. The one off-thread writer is the background
source watcher (:meth:`start_source_watch`, issue #44), which re-lists from its
own daemon thread. It only ever *rebinds* ``self.sources`` to a fresh dict
returned by ``list_sources()`` (never mutates the dict in place), so readers on
other threads see either the whole old catalog or the whole new one under the
GIL — no torn reads, hence no lock. ``connect()`` is still expected on one
thread at a time.

        needs none, and if the user's config enables token generation the CLI
        prints it to the console. Output is not captured so any such printed
